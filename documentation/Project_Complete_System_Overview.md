# 🚀 Twitter Clone Project - Complete System Overview

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Tech Stack

Your project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Twitter clone with real-time features. Here's how everything connects:

**Frontend:** React 18 + Redux Toolkit + React Router + Styled Components + Socket.io Client
**Backend:** Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB + JWT + Socket.io + Multer (file uploads)
**Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
**Real-time:** Socket.io for live chat and notifications

---

## 🔄 How Everything Works Together - Step by Step

### 1. Starting the Project (`npm run dev`)

When you run `npm run dev`, it simultaneously starts:
- **Backend Server** (Port 5000) - runs `server/server.js`
- **Frontend Client** (Port 3000) - runs `client/src/index.js`

The `concurrently` package runs both servers at the same time, and the client has a proxy configured to `http://localhost:5000` for API calls.

**Home Page Top Section:**
The hashtags and profiles section at the top of the home page comes from `client/src/pages/Home.js` (lines 25-75) where the `HeaderTabs` component renders the navigation tabs for "For you" and "Following" feeds.

### 2. Initial Page Load Flow

```
User opens browser → React App loads → App.js renders → Layout.js wraps all pages → Home.js shows by default
```

**App.js** is your main entry point that:
- Sets up Redux store and theme provider
- Handles routing with React Router
- Automatically tries to load user from JWT token on app start
- Redirects to login if no valid token exists

### 3. Authentication Flow (Login/Register)

```
Login.js/Register.js → Redux Action → Axios API Call → Backend Auth Controller → MongoDB User Check → JWT Token → Store in Redux + LocalStorage
```

**Backend Process:**
- `server/routes/auth.js` receives requests
- `server/controllers/auth.js` handles login/register logic
- `server/models/User.js` validates credentials against MongoDB
- JWT token generated and sent back
- Frontend stores token and user data in Redux state

### 4. Home Page & Tweet System

```
Home.js loads → Redux fetches posts → Tweet.js components render → User can create new tweets → MediaUpload handles files → FormattedInput with emoji support
```

**Tweet Creation Flow:**
- User types in `FormattedInput` component (`client/src/components/FormattedInput.js`)
- `MediaUpload` handles image/video uploads via Multer
- Redux action sends POST to `/api/posts`
- Backend saves to MongoDB
- Real-time updates via Socket.io

**Tweet Display:**
- `Tweet.js` component renders each post (`client/src/components/Tweet.js`, lines 1-741)
- Handles likes, retweets, comments
- Shows user avatars, timestamps, media content
- Interactive buttons for engagement

**Tweet Engagement Data Storage:**
Likes and comments are saved in the database through the Post model (`server/models/Post.js`). The likes array stores user IDs who liked the post, and comments are stored as separate documents with references to the parent post. The count is calculated in real-time when rendering, but the actual data is stored as arrays of user IDs for likes and comment objects for replies.

### 5. Real-Time Chat System (Messages.js)

```
Socket.io connection → Join user rooms → Send/receive messages → Real-time updates → Encrypted messaging support
```

**Chat Architecture:**
- **Socket.io** creates persistent connections
- Users join personal rooms (`user:userId`) and chat rooms (`chat:conversationId`)
- Messages sent via `send_message` socket event
- Backend saves to MongoDB and emits to recipients
- Supports encrypted messages and file attachments
- Real-time conversation updates and notifications

**Key Components:**
- `Messages.js` - Main chat interface (`client/src/pages/Messages.js`, lines 1-2553)
- `server/services/message.js` - Message handling logic
- Socket.io events for real-time communication
- File upload support for media sharing

**Encrypted Messaging Implementation:**
Encrypted messaging is supported through the `client/src/utils/encryption.js` utility. When a user sends an encrypted message:
1. The message is encrypted using AES-256 encryption before sending
2. The encrypted content is stored in the database (`server/models/Message.js`)
3. The `isEncrypted` field is set to `true` in the message document
4. When receiving, the message is decrypted using the same encryption key
5. The encryption key is stored securely in the user's session

**Message Database Storage:**
Messages are saved in the database through the Message model (`server/models/Message.js`). Each message document contains:
- `sender`: Reference to the User model
- `recipient`: Reference to the User model  
- `content`: The message text (encrypted if `isEncrypted` is true)
- `isEncrypted`: Boolean flag for encryption status
- `attachments`: Array of media files
- `timestamp`: When the message was sent
- `conversationId`: Reference to the Conversation model

### 6. Database Structure & Models

```
MongoDB Collections:
├── Users (profiles, authentication)
├── Posts (tweets, media, engagement)
├── Conversations (chat threads)
├── Messages (individual chat messages)
└── Notifications (user alerts)
```

**MongoDB Connection:**
- `server/config/db.js` connects to MongoDB
- Mongoose schemas define data structure
- JWT middleware protects private routes

### 7. API Endpoints & Routes

```
Backend Routes:
├── /api/auth (login, register, user info)
├── /api/users (profiles, follows, search)
├── /api/posts (create, read, like, retweet)
├── /api/messages (chat functionality)
└── /api/search (user and content search)
```

**Frontend API Calls (Detailed):**
API calls are handled through Axios in various components and Redux slices:

**Authentication API Calls:**
- Login: `client/src/pages/Login.js` (lines 100-150) makes POST request to `/api/auth/login`
- Register: `client/src/pages/Register.js` makes POST request to `/api/auth/register`
- User loading: `client/src/redux/slices/authSlice.js` makes GET request to `/api/auth/me`

**Posts API Calls:**
- Fetch posts: `client/src/redux/slices/postSlice.js` makes GET request to `/api/posts`
- Create post: `client/src/redux/slices/postSlice.js` makes POST request to `/api/posts`
- Like/Unlike: `client/src/components/Tweet.js` makes PUT request to `/api/posts/:id/like`

**User API Calls:**
- Profile updates: `client/src/components/EditProfileModal.js` makes PUT request to `/api/users/profile`
- Follow/Unfollow: `client/src/pages/Profile.js` makes PUT request to `/api/users/:id/follow`

**Search API Calls:**
- User search: `client/src/components/Search.js` makes GET request to `/api/search/users`
- Content search: `client/src/pages/Explore.js` makes GET request to `/api/search/posts`

**Messages API Calls:**
- Fetch conversations: `client/src/pages/Messages.js` makes GET request to `/api/messages/conversations`
- Fetch messages: `client/src/pages/Messages.js` makes GET request to `/api/messages/:conversationId`

All API calls include JWT tokens in the Authorization header for authentication, and error handling is implemented in both the Redux slices and individual components.

### 8. State Management (Redux)

**Redux Introduction:**
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the global state of your app in a predictable way. In this project, we use Redux Toolkit, which is the official, opinionated way to write Redux logic.

**Redux Store Structure:**
```
Redux Store (`client/src/redux/store.js`):
├── authSlice (user login state, profile) - `client/src/redux/slices/authSlice.js`
├── postSlice (tweets, likes, retweets) - `client/src/redux/slices/postSlice.js`
├── searchSlice (search results) - `client/src/redux/slices/searchSlice.js`
└── themeSlice (dark/light mode, colors) - `client/src/redux/slices/themeSlice.js`
```

**Redux Code Location and Implementation:**
- **Store Configuration**: `client/src/redux/store.js` (lines 1-16)
- **Auth Slice**: `client/src/redux/slices/authSlice.js` - handles login, logout, user profile
- **Post Slice**: `client/src/redux/slices/postSlice.js` - manages tweets, likes, retweets
- **Search Slice**: `client/src/redux/slices/searchSlice.js` - handles search functionality
- **Theme Slice**: `client/src/redux/slices/themeSlice.js` - manages theme switching

**Redux Flow:**
1. **Actions dispatched** from components (e.g., `dispatch(login(credentials))`)
2. **Reducers update state** based on action types
3. **Components subscribe** to state changes using `useSelector`
4. **Async actions** handled with Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk`
5. **State persistence** through localStorage for themes and auth tokens

**Redux Usage in Components:**
- `client/src/App.js` (lines 30-40) - uses `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
- `client/src/pages/Home.js` (lines 15-20) - dispatches post actions
- `client/src/components/Tweet.js` (lines 10-15) - handles like/retweet actions
- `client/src/pages/Login.js` (lines 80-90) - dispatches login actions

### 9. File Upload System

```
MediaUpload component → Multer middleware → MongoDB storage → CDN-like serving → Real-time preview
```

**Multer Implementation:**
Multer is a Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files. In this project, it's configured in `server/middleware/upload.js` to handle profile pictures, cover photos, and media attachments.

**Complete Upload Flow:**

1. **File Selection** (`client/src/components/MediaUpload.js`):
   - User clicks upload button or drags files
   - File validation (type, size) happens in the browser
   - Preview is shown immediately using FileReader API

2. **File Upload to Server**:
   - FormData is created with the file and additional metadata
   - Axios POST request sent to `/api/upload` endpoint
   - Request includes JWT token for authentication

3. **Server-side Processing** (`server/middleware/upload.js`):
   - Multer middleware receives the file
   - File is validated (type, size, security checks)
   - Unique filename generated to prevent conflicts
   - File saved to `server/public/uploads/` directory

4. **Database Storage**:
   - File URL and metadata saved to appropriate model
   - Profile pictures: saved in User model (`server/models/User.js`)
   - Cover photos: saved in User model
   - Media attachments: saved in Post model (`server/models/Post.js`)

5. **File Serving**:
   - Files served statically from `/uploads` endpoint
   - CDN-like access through Express static middleware
   - Real-time access for immediate display

**File Types Supported:**
- Images: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Videos: MP4, MOV, AVI
- Maximum file size: 10MB for images, 50MB for videos

**Security Features:**
- File type validation using MIME type checking
- File size limits enforced
- Malicious file detection
- Secure file naming to prevent path traversal attacks

### 10. Theme System

```
Theme switching → Styled Components → CSS variables → Multiple color schemes (dark, light, purple, green, orange, pink)
```
